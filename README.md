# snsm - Simple Notes for Simple Man
I'm a simple man with simple need.

# Usage
just type `note` and enter the tags you're searching for. Selecting one will open it in your favorite `$EDITOR`. If you just enter a word followed by `.md` it will create that file for you and open it. It's just plain text files, you choose how you back it/sync it.

To tag a document just add them on the first line of your project like so
```md
// +golang +howto
# How to use goroutine
...
```

When searching for tags, if it finds nothing it will start looking into the content of the files.
